## üîç Overview

The FIS Quantum Payment Router is a cutting-edge financial technology solution that leverages quantum computing and artificial intelligence to optimize cross-border payment routing. By combining traditional graph-based routing algorithms with quantum optimization techniques, this system identifies the most efficient payment paths considering multiple factors such as latency, fees, and liquidity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Hybrid AI-Quantum Routing** - Uses AI for initial path prediction and quantum computing for path optimization
- **Multi-factor Optimization** - Considers transaction fees, latency times, and available liquidity
- **Interactive Web Interface** - User-friendly UI for visualizing and selecting optimal payment routes
- **Graph-based Network Modeling** - Models payment corridors as weighted network graphs
- **Quantum Circuit Optimization** - Utilizes QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) via Qiskit
- **Fallback Mechanisms** - Maintains traditional routing capabilities when quantum optimization is unavailable

## üèó Architecture

The system uses a three-layer architecture:

1. **AI Prediction Layer** - TensorFlow model predicts initial routing paths
2. **Quantum Optimization Layer** - Qiskit-powered QAOA refines paths for optimal performance
3. **Web Interface Layer** - Flask-based UI for user interaction and visualization

## üíª Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.8+
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow
- **Quantum Computing**: Qiskit, Qiskit Optimization
- **Graph Processing**: NetworkX
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/quantum-payment-router.git
cd quantum-payment-router
```

### Step 2: Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configuration
```

## üñ• Usage

### Starting the server
```bash
python payment_router.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Using the interface

1. Enter the payment amount
2. Select the start node (source bank)
3. Select the end node (destination bank)
4. Click "Find Optimal Route"
5. Review the optimized route and associated costs

## üìä API Reference

### Route a payment

```
POST /route
```

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "start": "A",
  "end": "E",
  "amount": 1000.00
}
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "ai_path": "A -> B -> E",
  "ai_cost": 28.0,
  "quantum_path": "A -> C -> D -> E",
  "quantum_cost": 25.0
}
```

## ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Optimization Algorithm

The system utilizes the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) implemented with Qiskit to find optimal payment routes. The process involves:

1. Converting the routing problem to a Quadratic Program
2. Transforming the Quadratic Program to a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)
3. Implementing QAOA with optimized mixing parameters
4. Sampling the resulting quantum state to determine the optimal path

## üß† AI Route Prediction

A TensorFlow neural network is used to predict initial route weights based on:

- Transaction fees
- Latency times
- Available liquidity

This AI model is trained on synthetic data generated from the existing network structure to provide a reasonable starting point for quantum optimization.
